A small set of python funtions
used to collect some shares data and do some stats.
This is mainly intended to be my first github experience to see what comes out.

It's intended to work in interactive mode using the shell and designed in quick way so to easily add new functionlities and play with the data. It's intentionally avoiding teh frills of a fancy used interface.
